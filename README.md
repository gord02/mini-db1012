## Project Description:

Title: Mini-Database (definitions)
## Title: Mini-Database (definitions):
In this project we would be creating a database of definitions, or a sort of dictionary with a limited number of words in it that only pertain to definitions on a specific subject. We could do more than just a one line definition, we could also add in pictures or diagrams(depending on the definition) to give very specific and detailed information about a specific word or subject matter. A specific example of subject set for the definition could be discrete Mathematics, all the definitions contained in the database would pertain to definitions found in discrete Mathematics 1019. There are a lot of different definitions and laws used in this course already and a database that allows you to quickly look through and find definitions and topics you might not be too confident in.  
<br />

Define 10 to 15 functional requirements of your project as a bullet list:
1. Users can scroll through the list of all available definitions which are in alphabetical order
2. User can search for specific definitions 
3. Users can request definitions be added(submit form on webpage, doesn't actually go anywhere though)
4. Users can scroll through available information on their specific search
5. Related search feature?
6. Quiz section and practice questions with solutions 
7. Most Searched words? (Too difficult?)
8. search based on specific topics (Laws, Rules of Inference, Chapter)-  Results still remain in Alphabetical order
9. Important links(links that could lead to extra resources like khan academy)
10. Important Date Reminder(Test, quiz and assignment dates)
11. Study Guide for various chapters of Chapter Groupings
