## Project Description:

Title: Mini-Database (definitions)
## Title: Mini-Database (definitions):
In this project we would be creating a database of definitions, or a sort of dictionary with a limited number of words in it that only pertain to definitions on a specific subject. We could do more than just a one line definition, we could also add in pictures or diagrams(depending on the definition) to give very specific and detailed information about a specific word or subject matter. A specific example of subject set for the definition could be discrete Mathematics, all the definitions contained in the database would pertain to definitions found in discrete Mathematics 1019. There are a lot of different definitions and laws used in this course already and a database that allows you to quickly look through and find definitions and topics you might not be too confident in.  
<br />

Define 10 to 15 functional requirements of your project as a bullet list:
1. Users on the main page of the website will see the definitions organized in alphabetical order which they can scroll through 
2. User can search bar at the top of the all pages to search for specific definitions
3. Users can request definitions be added(submit form that is found in contact us portion on webpage, doesn't actually go anywhere though)
4. Users after clicking onto a specific definition can scroll through available information on their specific search, wether than be through the images or diagrams or just text and examples for it.
5. Navbar pinned to the top of the screen with available sections on website such as quiz me, catagories etc..
6. Quiz section and practice questions with solutions 
6. Most Searched words. Users that frequently query for specific words will have the word show up in an available dropdown of words once the search bar is clicked.
7. A Search based on specific topics (Laws, Rules of Inference, Chapter) can be done when selecting the option in the main homescreen or categories in the navbar (results still remain in Alphabetical order)
8. Important links(links that could lead to extra resources like khan academy), which are found in the Resources tab in the navbar
<!-- 9. Important Date Reminder(Test, quiz and assignment dates) -->
10. Study Guide for various chapters of Chapter Groupings, found in navbar section
